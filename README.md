Here are **clear, concise impact points** (2 each) based on HSBC’s current NbS-related activities and the known challenges around data, verification, and scalability:

---

## **1. Financial Impact (How the challenge is costing the bank today)**

1. **High cost of monitoring and validating NbS projects** because data is fragmented, non-standardised, and often requires manual verification from partners like WWF/WRI, increasing project due-diligence and assurance costs.
2. **Lost revenue from slow scalability** — HSBC supports multiple NbS pilots globally, but cannot commercialise or expand them quickly due to lack of digitised tracking and impact measurement, resulting in missed sustainable finance opportunities.

---

## **2. Operational Impact (How the challenge affects efficiency today)**

1. **Long end-to-end turnaround times** for evaluating NbS projects because impact data, biodiversity metrics, and carbon estimates must be gathered, checked, and compared manually across multiple partners and geographies.
2. **High time spent on repetitive tasks** such as documentation review, data reconciliation, and cross-checking impact reports from WWF, WRI, and local project implementers, slowing internal teams and limiting capacity to scale.

---

## **3. Customer Impact (Internal & External)**

1. **External clients (corporates/investors)** get limited, non-real-time visibility into NbS impact, making HSBC’s sustainability offerings less competitive and reducing customer confidence in nature-linked financing products.
2. **Internal stakeholders** (sustainability teams, risk, CIB coverage) face delays in approving or structuring NbS-related deals due to slow data verification, making it harder to meet client timelines or originate new solutions.

If you want, I can also prepare:
✅ a one-slide impact summary,
✅ a quantified version (e.g., impact hours, cost drivers), or
✅ a problem statement for your project document.
